<p><code>dep</code>, the prototype for an <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep">official Go dependency management tool</a>, has been progressing wonderfully since opening up in January. We&rsquo;ve had dozens of community members step up with ideas and code, as well as untold numbers more testing out the tool on real workloads - the momentum has been awesome!</p>

<p><code>dep</code> is in an experimental phase - development has been rapid, and we&rsquo;ve pivoted in some key ways. And while we&rsquo;re learning a lot, it&rsquo;s also been hard for a casual observer to follow. To mitigate that, starting this week, I&rsquo;m going to (try to) publish a once-weekly update of what all&rsquo;s going on with <code>dep</code>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll keep it as short as possible, focusing each post in three areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>General news - state of the roadmap, big changes that are incoming, etc.</li>
<li>What needs community attention over this coming week (max 3 items)</li>
<li>What we&rsquo;ve finished this past week</li>
</ul>

<p>Off we go!</p>

<h2 id="news-and-such">News and Such</h2>

<p>While it&rsquo;s important for us to maintain an experimental mindset with <code>dep</code>, we also want it to at least be stable enough that users can feel safe to commit their manifest and lock files. This is [the first item]() on our [roadmap](), and we&rsquo;re going to try to get it done by mid-May.</p>

<p>To that end, there&rsquo;s some big news - I&rsquo;ve just merged a <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/342">PR</a> moving from JSON to TOML for the manifest (<code>manifest.json</code> -&gt; <code>Gopkg.toml</code>) and lock (<code>lock.json</code> -&gt; <code>Gopkg.lock</code>) files. This is, of course, a major step towards stabilizing the files.</p>

<p>Also, gps is going to be <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/300">moving directly into <code>dep</code> as a subpackage</a>. This will make contributing easier, centralize issues into one repository, and shorten <code>dep</code>&rsquo;s overall development cycle.</p>

<h2 id="community-attention-needed">Community Attention Needed!</h2>

<ul>
<li>As our current focus is on stabilizing the metadata files,</li>
<li>Help with reviewing <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep/pulls">PRs</a> for general issues, coding style, testing completeness, etc., is VERY helpful. Finding time to do good reviews is currently a <em>huge</em> progress blocker, and if the maintainers can focus our review time only on correctness with respect to the spec, it would be tremendously helpful.</li>
<li>Docs! Docs docs docsdocsddocodcsdscosdoocso <strong>DOCS</strong>. Ideally, folks who are willing to not just write particular docs, but also do some thinking about how to organize docs sanely.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="stuff-we-ve-ed">Stuff We&rsquo;ve ðŸš¢ed</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot to put in here, as a number of PRs have landed that have been open for several weeks.</p>

<ul>
<li>We&rsquo;ve added a <code>dep prune</code> subcommand, which will trim out unneeded packages and files from your <code>vendor/</code> directory. There&rsquo;s a better-than-even chance that this command won&rsquo;t actually stay in <code>dep</code>, because [reasons](), but it exists now</li>
<li>We started splitting gps up into <a href="https://github.com/sdboyer/gps/pull/189">multiple packages</a>.</li>
<li>I finally finished <a href="https://github.com/sdboyer/gps/pull/196">a large refactor of gps</a>, eliminating some race conditions that were responsible for a number of bugs in dep. (These upstream changes aren&rsquo;t merged into <code>dep</code> just yet, though).</li>
<li>We&rsquo;ve implemented support for <a href="https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/247">symlinking project roots</a>. This is <em>very</em> basic, and only for the project root, but it should help with some common ways people set up their environments.</li>
