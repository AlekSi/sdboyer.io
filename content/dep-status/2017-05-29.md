It's time for the `dep` roundup!

## News and Such

We've hit our first big roadmap milestone - [stabilizing `Gopkg.toml` and `Gopkg.lock`](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/276)! From this point forward, we guarantee that all changes to those files will be backwards-compatible. It's now officially recommended to commit both of those files into your repository. The [meta PR](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/644) also breaks existing files, of course, but it also has reasonably straightforward instructions for manually converting them. 

Ordinarily I avoid releases on Fridays, but I think the opposite approach makes more sense here. Even though we've warned people of this impending change, and not to rely seriously on `dep` yet, they inevitably will. By releasing over a weekend, there's a better chance of individual/hobbyist projects poking at it first, which may give a bit of a smoother ride.

One of the things that delayed hitting this release was [a conversation on the go-package-management google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/go-package-management/fp2uBMf6kq4). [@zombiezen](https://github.com/zombiezen) and [@rakyll](https://github.com/rakyll) raised some entirely reasonable questions about how, in a `dep` world, they might release a new, backwards-incompatible major version of [golang.org/x/oauth2](https://golang.org/x/oauth2), but facilitate incremental refactoring by providing [shims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shim_(computing)) between the two major versions.

We haven't come to a good answer yet. (I'm not worried - I have a guess about what a workable solution will look like.) But these were reasonable questions, and we had just _zero_ documentation around issues of project lifecycle maintenance. Because metadata file stabilization means that growth of the new Go package ecosystem has begun, it seemed rather important to have at least some _basic_ guidance in place.

So, I [whipped](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-do-i-roll-releases-that-dep-will-be-able-to-use) [out](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-does-dep-decide-what-version-of-a-dependency-to-use) [some](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md#what-semver-version-should-i-use) [new](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md#is-it-ok-to-make-backwards-incompatible-changes-now) [FAQ entries](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md#my-dependers-dont-use-dep-yet-what-should-i-do). These are just a scant beginning of the work to be done - many years of conventional wisdom about release practices in Go are now poised for change (though [not too much!](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md#is-it-ok-to-make-backwards-incompatible-changes-now)). I hope to see a lot of conversations about best practices emerging in the coming weeks and months.

With that roadmap item out of the way, the next thing [on the roadmap](https://github.com/golang/dep/wiki/Roadmap) is [implementing and stabilizing the command set](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/277). Work's already been proceeding quietly here for a while - hopefully we'll move through it quickly!


## Community Attention Needed!

In past updates, I've used this section to pick out some specific issues that need help. But it doesn't seem to have been particularly effective - and besides, [we have a label for that](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted). So, I'm going to change it up. 

Instead of focusing on specific tickets that a lot of attention from a small number of people, I'm going to highlight things that are more suitable for a little attention from a lot of people. And not so much "things" as "thing" - just one focus area, per week.

This week, with the files stabilized and the tool safe for long-term use, the focus area is pretty clear: I'd love to see folks post issues to the dep queue with their *questions* about how `dep` should be used to fulfill existing use cases and workflows. It's fine - even preferred - for such issues to be more discussion oriented than the more typical "feature plz" or "ugh bugs".

That should go something like this:

1. Grab `dep` - `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep`
2. Try converting some of your projects
3. Poke at `dep` until you have some questions about how it'll work for the way you ship Go code
4. Give a quick check through the issue queue, and if you don't see anything similar, post an issue with these questions!

Here's an example: we're paying close attention to `dep`'s utility for Kubernetes, as it's a good high-water mark for the complexity and scale the tool must handle. This week, [@sttts](https://github.com/sttts) opened [a PR](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/638) experimenting with some changes to mimic Kubernetes' "staging" system.

Now, Kubernetes is an outlier, and these particular changes are unlikely to make it into `dep`. But that's fine! We still learn a lot by seeing these examples. Just, don't overthink it - if it's at all unclear how you'd accomplish your goals with `dep`, then bring us an unvarnished description of your workflow, and we'll figure it out.

## Stuff We've ðŸš¢ed

The pace of pull requests continues to run high, so I'm gonna focus on the more user-visible items:

* In the meta-PR to stabilize the files, [@felipeweb](https://github.com/felipeweb) [renamed the `Gopkg.toml` fields](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/538), and [@carolynvs](https://github.com/carolynvs) knocked out the [implicit semver caret constraints](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/631).
* [@darkowlzz](https://github.com/darkowlzz) [overhauled the feedback](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/512) presented during `dep init`. Instead of generic "progress" messages, we now tell you which versions we've inferred for each dependency.
* [@jonstacks](https://github.com/jonstacks) fixed some harmfully misleading output, where `dep init` would include a `[[constraint]]` (nÃ©e `[[dependencies]]`) entry in `Gopkg.toml` even if [it was unconstrained](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/585).
* [@spenczar](https://github.com/spenczar) improved the error output when `dep` [fails to  connect with a vanity import server](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/561) for its [`go-get` metadata](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Remote_import_paths). This is not a small thing - import deduction failures can be a very nasty and confusing class of failure.
* [@sectioneight](https://github.com/sectioneight) added previously-neglected [support for `-unstable` in `gopkg.in` import paths](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/587).
* And some 30+ less visible bug fixes, code reorganizations, et. all. Phew!
