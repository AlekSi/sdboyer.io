It's time for the weekly `dep` roundup!

## News and Such

The big news this week is clear: thanks to [@kris-nova](https://github.com/kris-nova)'s indefatigable efforts, [gps is now a part of dep!](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/453) No more indirect coordination or split issue queues - we can fix bugs and add features to the solver directly. And no, the irony of moving a dependency management library into a dependency management tool to make dependency management easier is not lost on us.

The main focus continues to be [stabilizing Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/276). I opened up [a](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/506) [few](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/508) [issues](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/509) last night, all of which would be breaking changes, but none of which should be horribly complicated. Our upstream semver dependency also [merged in](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver/pull/52) the last of our requirements. The finish line is in sight!

This is open source, though, so it means different folks have different interests, and other aspects of the project have been moving forward as well. In particular, the [updated command spec](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/276) has been solidifying, and work on implementing it is moving forward. There are some user-facing changes in `dep init`'s behavior - have a look! If current trajectory holds, it seems likely that we'll be most of the way there by the time we stabilize the files.

## Community Attention Needed!

Here's this week's big three:

* First and foremost - please, let's push on [stabilizing Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/276)!
* Reiterating the call from last week to [TAG YOUR RELEASES](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/06/24/gophers-please-tag-your-releases) with semver. And let's maybe just settle on [Bradley Falzon's apicompat](https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/apicompat) as where we put our efforts to create a tool to suggest the next semver version.
* It would be _great_ if we could get some folks to start working on [auto-converters for other tools' file formats](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/186). There's only been [movement on glide](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/380) so far, but e.g. Godep oughtn't be that hard, and could be [a real boon to folks](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go/issues/78#issuecomment-298256991).

## Stuff We've ðŸš¢ed

It's been a busy week!

* [@kris-nova](https://github.com/kris-nova) is spectacular software sorceress and [moved gps into dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/453).
* We moved some of our CI responsibility over to codeclimate, including test coverage checks. Even though our test harness runs in a way that [hides good coverage numbers](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/510), it's quite fair to say there's a ways to go ðŸ˜Š.
* We refined the generated help text a bit in `Gopkg.toml`, and also gave the user control over [whether it should be included at all](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/477) via a new flag. Thanks, [@EwanValentine](https://github.com/EwanValentine)!
* [@darkowlzz](https://github.com/darkowlzz) [fixed](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/470) [a longstanding, confusing issue](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/149) where `Gopkg.toml` would be left empty if there wasn't any info on disk to work from.
* Our test harness [is now more robust](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/402) and capable of modeling error cases - crucial for testing anything other than the happy path. Thanks, [@domgreen](https://github.com/domgreen)!
* [@ChrisHines](https://github.com/ChrisHines) helped sand off nasty edges around [Windows](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/498) and [symlinks](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/495).
