It's time for the weekly `dep` roundup!

## News and Such

The big thing that's in-flight is [moving gps into dep](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/453). It's a somewhat arduous process (which should be surprising to no one), but [@kris-nova](https://github.com/kris-nova)'s on it. I'm hoping we'll be able to finalize the merge by the end of this week. Once gps is in, it'll be much easier for everyone to fix bugs directly and iterate on features that `dep` needs.

While I haven't gotten to writing up what I figured out last week for [OS/arch/build tag parameterization](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/291), I'm now pretty sure that we'll be able to make whatever changes we'll need as non-disruptive additions to the files later on. This is great, as it means we can declare the files stable sooner, and `dep` therefore ready for more serious use.

This week/early next is likely to be a bit slow, at least for me, as the machine I use for `dep` work is going in for repairs.

## Community Attention Needed!

Here's this week's big three:

* We're making some progress on documentation, in at least the preliminary form of an [FAQ](https://github.com/golang/dep/blob/master/FAQ.md). If folks have questions about dep that aren't answered in what's there now (and there definitely should be questions!), then file an issue with your question, and we'll get the FAQ updated!
* We need to [compile a list of generally well-known and understood build tags](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/463) (pursuant to [OS/Arch/build tag parameterization](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/277)). We don't know exactly how we'll use them yet, but we know the list will be useful.
* It's going to become suddenly very important, very soon, that [we have tagged releases for projects](https://dave.cheney.net/2016/06/24/gophers-please-tag-your-releases). I'll spare the handwaving details, but if the ecosystem converts too slowly to tagging releases, it could make thing hairy for everyone. The more depended on your project is, the more important it is that you start tagging with semver **now**, if you haven't already. (Next step is solidifying a helper tool to suggest a correct next semver release version - e.g., [Bradley Falzon's apicompat](https://github.com/bradleyfalzon/apicompat))


Also, while we're in a bit of a holding pattern around the gps move, [this issue](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/409) is very concerning to me. It's _essential_ for reliability that `dep` handles the cache of repositories well, and I'd hoped my last major gps changeset would have fixed this. If anyone's looking for some serious code spelunking, consider that issue an ominous cave entrace! ðŸ˜„

## Stuff We've ðŸš¢ed

* [@carolynvs](https://github.com/carolynvs) did the legwork on the [first pass](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/401) at our FAQ.
* If `dep init` would have generated an empty Gopkg.toml, it now instead creates one with examples for how to declare dependency constraints - [thanks](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/374) [@EwanValentine](https://github.com/EwanValentine)! I've also opened a [follow-up](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/462) that expands the help text to cover all Gopkg.toml properties, and includes the commented examples regardless of whether Gopkg.toml would have been empty.
* [@y0ssar1an](https://github.com/y0ssar1an) further expanded `dep`'s CI process by [introducing](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/457) [gosimple](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/gosimple). I'm happy to say we already passed almost all the checks ðŸ˜„
* [@mem](https://github.com/mem) solved [a problem that's been plaguing us for a while](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/213) - when figuring out which GOPATH the tool was operating within, we were relying on `filepath.HasPrefix()` to (we thought) provide cross-platform, and appropriately case-[in]sensitive prefix checking. But that function is deprecated and doesn't do the job - so now, we have our own! It's pretty nifty and probably mostly right, but it involves some Unicode black magic, so another review from experienced eye would be most welcome.
