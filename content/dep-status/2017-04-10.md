`dep`, the prototype official dependency management tool for Go, has been progressing well since [we opened it up in January](). We've had dozens of community members step up with ideas and code, as well as untold numbers more testing out the tool on real workloads - the momentum has been awesome!

We're in an experimental phase - development has been rapid, and we've pivoted in some key ways. And while we're learning a lot, it's also made progress hard to follow casually. So, starting this week, I'm going to (try to) publish a once-weekly update of what all's going on with `dep`.

I'll keep it as short as possible, focusing each post in three areas:

* General news - state of the roadmap, big changes that are incoming, etc.
* What needs community attention over this coming week (max 3 items)
* What we've finished this past week

Off we go!

## News and Such

While it's important for us to maintain an experimental mindset with `dep`, we also want it to at least be stable enough that users can feel safe to commit their manifest and lock files. This is [the first item]() on our [roadmap](), and we're going to try to get it done by mid-May.

To that end, there's some big news - I've just merged a [PR](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/342) moving from JSON to TOML for the manifest (`manifest.json` -> `Gopkg.toml`) and lock (`lock.json` -> `Gopkg.lock`) files. This is, of course, a major step towards stabilizing the files.

Also, gps is going to be [moving directly into `dep` as a subpackage](https://github.com/golang/dep/issues/300). This should ease contributions to it, centralize issues into one place, and shorten the overall development cycle.

## Attention Needed!

* As our current focus is on stabilizing the metadata files, 
* Help with reviewing [PRs](https://github.com/golang/dep/pulls) for general issues, coding style, testing completeness, etc., is VERY helpful. Finding time to do good reviews is currently a _huge_ progress blocker, and if the maintainers can focus our review time only on correctness with respect to the spec, it would be tremendously helpful.
* Docs! Docs docs docsdocsddocodcsdscosdoocso DOCS. Ideally, folks who are willing to not just write particular docs, but also do some thinking about how to organize docs sanely.

## Stuff We've Shipped ðŸš¢

There's a lot to put in here, as a number of PRs have landed that have been open for several weeks.

* We've added a `dep prune` subcommand, which will trim out unneeded packages and files from your `vendor/` directory. There's a better-than-even chance that this command won't actually stay in `dep`, because [reasons]().
* We started splitting gps up into [multiple packages](https://github.com/sdboyer/gps/pull/189).
* I finally finished [a large refactor of gps](https://github.com/sdboyer/gps/pull/196), eliminating some race conditions that were responsible for a number of bugs in dep.
* We've implemented support for [symlinking project roots](https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/247). This is *very* basic, and only for the project root, but it should help with some common ways people set up their environments.
